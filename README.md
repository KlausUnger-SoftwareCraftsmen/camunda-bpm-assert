# ![camunda logo](./camunda-bpm-fest-assertions/src/main/resources/images/camunda.png)&nbsp;camunda-bpm-assert 

This little community-extension to [camunda BPM](http://camunda.org) wants to make it easier to write tests for BPMN process definitions executed with the camunda process engine. 
For that reason, a set of **assertions** based on the [fest-2](https://github.com/alexruiz/fest-assert-2.x/wiki) fixtures for easy software testing are provided...

![fest-assert-2](https://raw.github.com/wiki/alexruiz/fest-assert-2.x/images/fest-header-image-black-text.png)

â€¦ as well as a few little helpers to make it a bit easier to drive you through your process. Hopefully this will also make it easier to change your tests half a year after you have written them yourself!-) In short: more **readable code** - less **spaghetti tests**!

## Getting started

**BEWARE: The project is currently (*January 2014*) undergoing a major rework. Therefore it will last a few more days until a version *0.7* will be published. Until then, please feel free to checkout below mentioned 0.7-SNAPSHOT.** Previous versions found in the download section do not fully comply to the information given in this guide.

### Maven dependency

First, [declare the camunda BPM maven repository](http://www.camunda.org/get-started/#apache-maven) - if you haven't yet done so. Then you find here the coordinates for including camunda-bpm-assert in Apache Maven Projects:

```xml  
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>org.camunda.bpm.incubation</groupId>
    	<artifactId>camunda-bpm-fest-assertions</artifactId>
    	<version>0.7-SNAPSHOT</version>
    	<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
```

### Add a static import to your test class

Then, create your test case just as described in [camunda BPM Testing](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#testing). Two things you have to add then 

 * the following static import:

```xml  
	import static org.camunda.bpm.engine.test.fluent.ProcessEngineTests.*;
```
  
 * the initialisation code to make the assertions aware of your process engine, e.g. via the junit rule:
 
```java  
   @Before
   public void setUp() {
     init(processEngineRule.getProcessEngine());
   }
```
	
### Start using camunda-bpm-assert!

Now you have access to all the assertions provided by the fest library - plus the customised camunda BPM assertions provided by this library. Let's assume you want to assert that your process instance 

 * was actually started 
 * is waiting at a specific user task and
 * the task is yet unassigned, but waiting to be assigned to a user of a specific group:
 
![Green Bar](./camunda-bpm-fest-assertions/src/main/resources/images/job-announcement.png)

Then write:

```java	
	assertThat(processInstance).isStarted()
		.task().hasDefinitionKey("edit")
			.hasCandidateGroup("SB-Personal")
			.isUnassigned();
```

Green bar?

Congrats! You are successfully using camunda-bpm-assert. Find a more detailed description of the assertions and helper methods available in the [**camunda-bpm-assert User Guide**](./camunda-bpm-fest-assertions/README.md).
