# Introduction

This project aims at improving test creation **and maintenance** when developing process applications based on [the camunda BPM platform](http://camunda.org). 
Specifically, it focuses on the following aspects:

* enable test of process behavior
* foster involvement of the business during test creation
* ease the readability and maintainability of process model tests
* make the creation of process model tests more fluent and, thus more fun!
* make it easy to mock the services available to a process instance

# Libraries

This project provides a tool set for different testing approaches. This starts with generic JUnit test with an in-memory engine and ends with BDD-Style integration tests. 


| Module | Description |
| ----------------| --- |
| **camunda-bpm-testing-core** | foundation and basis for testing with Camunda BPM platform. |
| **camunda-bpm-testing-examples** | shared examples for demonstrating different testing strategies and techniques. |
| **camunda-bpm-jbehave** | is a basis for writing behaviour specifications and test process up-front of implementation and later after integration |
| **camunda-bpm-fluent-engine-api** | provides a [fluent](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html) Camunda BPM API so you can focus on your process expert's domain knowledge while writing and reading your tests |
| **camunda-bpm-fest-assertions** | provides a [fluent](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html) convenience methods, matchers and assertions for testing. |
| **camunda-bpm-needle** | is offering an integration to Needle Mocking provider framework, which eases the use of Mocking Frameworks in Camunda tests and helps to test components with Dependency Injection. |
